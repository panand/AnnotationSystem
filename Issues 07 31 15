1. POST vs. PUT
  the crucial difference is idempotency (identicality on multiple iterations of the call):
    POST: idempotent -- calling another instance of POST with the exact same request doesn't update the server state (there may be a different response, but the server doesn't change state)
    PUT: non-idempotent -- calling another instance of PUT with the exact same request will update
    so, if you are incrementing something, use PUT; if you are adding something unique, use POST
2. What is Postman?
    a website to do what curl does
  
3. What is next in param?
    next is a piece of middleware
4. app.get vs. router.get?
    there is no real difference here, other than making your code neater.
    the convention is to break the application into many subparts
      each subpart will need to get access to the router part of the app. router does that.
      it also allows own to segment the routes along the lines of the various files (router.get('CONTROLLER/blah/blah', ...)
